# Simulations
- Tests:
  * Fuel cell: different p, theta, Co
  * Porous medium: No obstacles, philic, phobic, neutral, square, circle
  * Nucleation: Square, sinus, 3 thetas

  -> Energy landscape on substrate / wall energy (cf. article Marc Pradas).
  -> Plot V against l (location of center of mass).
  -> Channel without pore. Generate pictures:
        - Vary pressures at inflow.
        - Vary wetting properties at substrate.
        - Topological perturbations on substrate (little waves).
        - Different Re, Pe, We
